# CountingTriangles

This is a Jupyter notebook written in Python that was used to discover the formulae for counting the number of equilaterial triangles within a trapezium as described in the Researchgate article [counting equilateral triangles within a trapezium](https://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.11328.76800 "Researchgate")
![Triangles in trapezium](trapez01.svg).

In the notebook the triangle sum is computed by brute force for various base and height lengths; thereafter the results are compared with those obtained by the sum formulae.
